<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) have become essential components in modern decision-making processes, assisting humans in domains such as healthcare, finance, logistics, education, and governance. As these systems increasingly rely on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational intelligence, ensuring fairness, transparency, and trustworthiness has emerged as a critical research priority. Traditional approaches often emphasize accuracy and efficiency, but still ignore critical aspects related to ethical reasoning, interpretability, and the management of uncertainty, all of which are necessary to guarantee responsible and fair decision outcomes.
This special session aims to provide a multidisciplinary platform for the IEEE fuzzy systems community to explore theoretical advances, methodological developments, and practical applications that address fairness and trustworthiness in intelligent decision support. In particular, fuzzy logic and related soft computing paradigms offer powerful mechanisms to support decisions that are both explainable and aligned with human reasoning. By integrating fuzzy systems with modern IDSS, AI, machine learning, and data-driven models, researchers can design hybrid approaches that enhance the interpretability and ethical accountability of automated decision-making.
